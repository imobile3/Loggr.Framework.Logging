Loggr.Extensions.Logging
=======================

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/e4s6reeh69qf580p/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/iMobile3/loggr-extensions-logging/branch/master) [![NuGet Version](http://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Loggr.Extensions.Logging.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Loggr.Extensions.Logging/)

Log to [Loggr][0] from [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging][1].

Installation
------------

Loggr.Extensions.Logging installs through [NuGet][3]:

```
PS> Install-Package Loggr.Extensions.Logging
```

Configure the Loggr provider through code:

```c#
var factory = new LoggerFactory();
var logger = factory.CreateLogger( "MyLog" );
factory.AddLoggr( "logKey", "apiKey" );
```

In the example we create a new `LoggerFactory` and add the Loggr provider using the `AddLoggr` extension method with a `logKey` and `apiKey` provided by Loggr.

Usage
-----

Log messages to Loggr, just as with every other provider:

```c#
logger.LogInformation( "This is information" );
```

This library currently uses the [loggr-dotnet][2] source directly since their NuGet package doesn't support .NET Core.
